## 📦 Installation

ReactBlocks doesn't require any installation or setup. It's a copy-paste component library.

**Prerequisites:**

- A React project (Next.js is recommended)
- Tailwind CSS properly installed and configured
- Basic understanding of React components and JSX

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Browse Components** - Visit [react-blocks.dev/components](https://react-blocks.dev/components)
2. **Copy the Code** - Click "View Code" and copy the component
3. **Paste Into Your Project** - Create a new file and paste the code

That's it! No `npm install`, no configuration files, just copy and code.

## 🎨 Customization

Every component is built entirely with Tailwind CSS utility classes:

- **Change Colors** - Replace color classes (e.g., `bg-blue-600` → `bg-purple-600`)
- **Adjust Sizes** - Modify padding, margins, or font sizes
- **Add Animations** - Integrate Framer Motion, GSAP, or other libraries
- **Dark Mode** - All components use Tailwind's `dark:` variants

You own the code, so modify it however you need!
